Microservices by Example
========================

This repository shows a simple example of an offer generation system. This is implemented using both RESTful and Eventing styles of microservice architecture.

## The Brief

As a consumer I want to receive the best flight offers between Melbourne and Brisbane available to me. These offers should be personalised depending on my preferences. I can enter the following preferences

 - Level of Service (Full/Budget)
 - If they are frequent flyer
 - Time of day

## The Implementations

### Eventing

### RESTFul

## Running the code

# TODO
- Create config with the two urls
- Make changing tabs load the data from different URL
- Loading spinner
- A form to personalise the results
- Make the offer list a directive

Running the app

## Make sure docker is up and running
- boot2docker start
- export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.59.103:2376
- export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/Users/braiden.judd/.boot2docker/certs/boot2docker-vm
- export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
