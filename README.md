Microservices by Example
========================

This repository shows a simple example of an offer generation system. This is implemented using both RESTful and Eventing styles of microservice architecture.

## The Brief

As a consumer I want to receive the best flight offers between Melbourne and Brisbane available to me. These offers should be personalised depending on my preferences. I can enter the following preferences

 - Level of Service (Full/Budget)
 - If I am a One World or Star Alliance FF
 - Time of day
 - 

## The Implementations

### Eventing

### RESTFul

## Running the code

# TODO
- Create config with the two urls
- Make changing tabs load the data from different URL
- Loading spinner
- A form to personalise the results
- Make the offer list a directive
